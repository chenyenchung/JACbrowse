# JAC Browse

The purpose of this Shiny app is to better utilize the publish datasets that are of interest in the **JAC Lab**, but it would of course be even better if it could also help the community.

Currently, this app wraps the following datasets:

- Abernathy, D. G. et al. [MicroRNAs Induce a Permissive Chromatin Environment that Enables Neuronal Subtype-Specific Reprogramming of Adult Human Fibroblasts.](http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S193459091730320X) Cell Stem Cell 21, 332–348.e9 (2017).
  - TRAP-seq of mouse spinal motor neuron and generic neuron in the spinal cord

- Rhee, H. S. et al. [Expression of Terminal Effector Genes in Mammalian Neurons Is Maintained by a Dynamic Relay of Transient Enhancers.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2016.11.037) Neuron 92, 1252–1265 (2016).
  - RNA-seq of spinal motor neurons differentiated _in vitro_ from mouse embryonic stem cell

- Kiskinis E, Sandoe J, Williams LA, Boulting GL et al. [Pathways disrupted in human ALS motor neurons identified through genetic correction of mutant SOD1.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24704492) Cell Stem Cell 2014 Jun 5;14(6):781-95. 
  - RNA-seq of human spinal motor neurons differentiated _in vitro_ from induced pluripotent stem cell from an ALS patient carrying SOD1^+/A4V^ mutation

## Updates

- 2018/06/15:
  - Added human MN dataset from Kiskinis _et al._.
  - Testing batch query on HMC dataset and human ALS dataset
