> Rhee, H. S. et al. [Expression of Terminal Effector Genes in Mammalian Neurons Is Maintained by a Dynamic Relay of Transient Enhancers.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2016.11.037) _Neuron_ **92**, 1252â€“1265 (2016).

This dataset comes from the Wichterle lab. The samples are _in vitro_ directed differentiated motor neurons, with the addition of DAPT, a gamma secretase inhibitor and Notch signaling blocker. This differentiation protocol features a higher yield of motor neuron and a more synchronized trajectory. In contrast to the standard protocol with retinoic acid and SAG only, this dataset should better resemble **HMC** fate.
